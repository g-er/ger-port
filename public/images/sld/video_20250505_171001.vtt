00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Okay. let's talk about that experience where you were outdoors. looking up at the historical

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.600
buildings and trees under a cloudy sky.

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.560
This one had a more contemplative. almost majestic feel to it. a blend of nature. grand

4
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.400
architecture. and intellectual discussion.

5
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.880
Your perspective was often directed upwards. taking in the canopy of tall trees. swaying

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.160
against that dynamic. partly cloudy sky.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.840
You caught glimpses of these large. white. classical style buildings. one that looked

8
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.320
like a palace or a grand museum. with all its windows and architectural flourishes.

9
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.480
and another with a prominent dome.

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.200
It sounds like a really picturesque setting. and woven into this visual experience was

11
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.280
an ongoing conversation in Lithuanian about artistic concepts.

12
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.640
I picked up on mentions of Viennese. Unity. and Organismus. Organism. Scenergis. Scenario.

13
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.000
and Shualaikin Dramaturgija. Contemporary Dramaturgy. so you were immersed in this thoughtful

14
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.400
discussion while being surrounded by some pretty impressive scenery.

15
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.480
The sounds were mostly natural. wind in the trees. maybe some faint distant city hum.

16
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.440
which would have complimented that reflective mood.

17
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.240
Your role here seemed to be that of an attentive observer of the environment. and an engaged

18
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.600
listener to the conversation.

19
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.560
You were likely part of a small group. perhaps with the male speaker. whose voice was most

20
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.880
prominent. discussing these artistic or academic topics in this calming outdoor space. maybe

21
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.440
a park or a courtyard near those historical buildings.

22
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.920
Your camerawork. with its upward tilts and pans. suggested a relaxed observation. taking

23
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.400
in the grandeur of the surroundings.

24
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.480
Now. thinking about navigating that kind of experience. your ability to be present in

25
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.200
both the physical environment and the intellectual discussion is a definite strength.

26
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.000
You were taking it all in.

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.240
If you wanted to more actively bridge the two. the conversation and the surroundings. you

28
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.720
could have looked for moments to connect them.

29
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.360
For instance. when the discussion touched on Unity. or Organism in Art. and you're looking

30
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.000
at this grand. cohesive piece of architecture. or the interconnected canopy of trees. you

31
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.760
might have shared an observation.

32
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.480
Something like. it's interesting you mention Unity. this building itself feels like such

33
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.240
a complete unified organism. or the way these branches interlock almost mirrors that idea

34
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.680
of an artistic organism we're talking about.

35
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.720
This isn't about forcing a connection. but if a genuine thought arose. linking the abstract

36
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.120
concepts to the tangible world you were all experiencing. sharing it could have enriched

37
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.680
the conversation for everyone. making the ideas feel even more grounded and immediate.

38
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.680
It's about weaving your sensory experience into the intellectual one.

39
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.320
You were clearly hearing the discussion and seeing the environment.

40
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.840
The next step. if desired. is to articulate the interplay between them to your companions.

41
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.840
Otherwise. your quiet appreciation of both aspects is perfectly valid and enjoyable

42
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.760
in its own right.
