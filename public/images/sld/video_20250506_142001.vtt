00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
All right. let's journey through that city walk that included the cafe stop.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.560
This one had a nice flow to it. moving through different urban settings and interactions.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.040
Your experience started on that riverside path. Then you navigated a street with all its traffic.

4
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.600
cars. buses. trucks. that e-bike delivery person. and lots of pedestrians.

5
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.680
The architecture was that familiar European style. Then your perspective shifted to the

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.280
outdoor seating area of the Noringa Cafe. a nice little pause before your view was briefly

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.800
obscured by your hand and then your clothing. After that. you were on the move again.

8
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.080
handling a plastic water bottle while walking past parked cars and more city buildings.

9
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.160
and it wrapped up with that quick glimpse inside another establishment. maybe a shop or another

10
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.320
cafe with people inside. Throughout. there was that ongoing Lithuanian conversation with your

11
00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.040
male companion. covering various topics like Jmaitijos Gatve. a pavilioness. the Noringa

12
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.160
Cafe itself. and something being Ziaoriai Jirai. awfully good. It was a real slice of city life.

13
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.640
movement. observation. a social pause. and casual chat. You were definitely an active observer

14
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.200
and participant. Navigating these different urban environments with your companion and

15
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.080
documenting the journey. you were engaged in conversation and also physically interacting

16
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.320
with things like your water bottle. Thinking about your social navigation here. you transitioned

17
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.880
smoothly between different modes. walking and talking. pausing at a cafe. even if just observing

18
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.280
the exterior seating. and then continuing your exploration. When your companion mentioned Noringa.

19
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.120
your camera then showed the cafe. which is a great example of the conversation guiding your

20
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.000
visual focus. making the experience feel integrated. The brief stop or focus on the Noringa Cafe's

21
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.240
outdoor seating area presented a subtle social moment. Even if you didn't sit down or interact

22
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.680
with anyone there. it was a shared point of interest with your companion. If you had been

23
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.800
inclined and if the cafe was part of your plan. that would have been a natural point to transition

24
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.600
from observing to participating in the cafe scene. perhaps discussing what to order or finding a table.

25
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.080
But even as a passing observation. it was a shared reference point.

26
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.920
Later. when you were handling your water bottle. it was a small natural action that grounds the

27
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.360
experience in everyday reality. The glimpse into the final establishment was very brief.

28
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.640
but it again showed your continued observation of the spaces around you. You were clearly comfortable

29
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.840
moving through these varied public and commercial spaces with your companion.

30
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.120
and the conversation flowed easily. indicating a good. relaxed dynamic. It's these kinds of casual

31
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.440
urban explorations. punctuated by small stops and ongoing chat. that often make for very pleasant

32
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.440
shared experiences.
