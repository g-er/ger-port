00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
Alright. let's dive into that kitchen scene.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.600
It sounds like a wonderfully typical and heartwarming moment with friends.

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.520
The kind where everyone just naturally gravitates towards the kitchen as a meal is coming together.

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.280
So. you were there. experiencing this unfold in the early evening. around 6 p.m. according

5
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.040
to the oven clock.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.560
Companion One. the one in the grey sweater. was initially quite busy. washing dishes at

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.080
the sink. then stirring a pot on the stove.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.920
It sounds like there was a comfortable. ongoing conversation in Lithuanian. probably about

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.240
the meal. with laughter punctuating the air.

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.200
Then. Companion Two. in the black hoodie. joined the action. taking over stirring the pot and

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.440
handling a large dish of what looked like pasta. getting it ready.

12
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.840
You were right there in the mix. close to the action. observing this collaborative effort.

13
00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.040
Your role seemed to be primarily that of an engaged observer in this particular snippet.

14
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.520
taking in the sights and sounds of your companions working together.

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.560
Yet. you were clearly part of the social fabric.

16
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.160
That playful comment from Companion One. Tau irgi neshnikik. you don't talk either. is

17
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.080
a lovely indicator that you were included in the lighthearted banter and the easygoing

18
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.520
atmosphere.

19
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.080
It suggests you were part of the conversational sphere. even if your verbal contributions

20
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.560
weren't captured in this segment.

21
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.040
Others were interacting naturally around you. which speaks to how comfortable and integrated

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.520
your presence was.

23
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.880
Now. thinking about social navigation in that kind of shared domestic activity. the analysis

24
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.560
touched on how you might have engaged more actively in the tasks themselves. if that

25
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.000
was something you desired at that moment.

26
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.440
For instance. when Companion One was busy at the sink and also trying to manage the

27
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.480
pot. or when Companion Two arrived and they were coordinating the pasta and stirring. there

28
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.320
could have been a natural opening to offer help.

29
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.720
You might have asked. need an extra pair of hands for stirring. or want me to take over

30
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.600
the washing up for a bit. or even something as simple as. what's next with the pasta.

31
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600
anything I can do to help?

32
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.320
Trying to jump in with a specific task. even a small one like chopping something. if relevant.

33
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.120
rinsing the colander. or clearing space on the counter. can often enhance that feeling

34
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.040
of shared effort and collaborative spirit that's so nice about cooking together.

35
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.720
It's not that your observational presence wasn't valuable. it clearly was. as you were

36
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.240
part of the comfortable social dynamic.

37
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.520
But if you were feeling the itch to be more hands-on in the preparation right then. those

38
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.360
little verbal offers are the way to bridge that.

39
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.080
Of course. sometimes the best role is simply to be present. enjoy the company. and keep

40
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.680
the conversation flowing. which it sounds like you were doing.

41
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.480
Your friends were clearly at ease with you there. sharing their space and their meal

42
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.160
preparation.

43
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.680
The atmosphere you experienced was light-hearted and friendly. and your presence contributed

44
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.120
to that.
