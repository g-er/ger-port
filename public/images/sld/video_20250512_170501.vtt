00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Okay. let's head to the grocery store for that shopping trip.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.920
This one felt like a very relatable everyday experience. making choices. discussing items.

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.120
and navigating the checkout process with a companion.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.640
You were in the grocery store. clearly with at least one male companion. and the two of

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.480
you were in the thick of deciding what to buy.

6
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.440
Your attention was moving through the aisles. taking in all those shelves stocked with drinks.

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.720
sodas. water. juices. and various snack foods.

8
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.240
You were definitely making selections together.

9
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.360
I heard your companion saying things like Ashnoryu. I want. and suggesting quantities

10
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.920
like Duosimdv. let's give two.

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.480
The experience then moved to that self-checkout kiosk.

12
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.120
Either you or your companion was scanning items. interacting with the touch screen.

13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.680
and listening to those automated prompts.

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.960
I've skied Kiki. Enter Quantity. Patekite Preca. Ipaka Vimo Krepchi. place item in bagging

15
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.120
area. and even that little English snippet item price has been identified.

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.240
Your hand was visible. interacting with the kiosk or the items. which really grounds your

17
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.480
presence in the activity.

18
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.040
Your role was clearly that of a shopper. actively involved in both selecting items and the checkout.

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.760
You were working in tandem with your companion. discussing prices. Viennese. Du. Ashnoryu.

20
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.440
Sulashisha. 1. 2. 8. with Salmon. and making those joint decisions.

21
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.360
The atmosphere was casual and conversational. just like a typical shopping trip.

22
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.880
Now. let's think about your social navigation in this setting.

23
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.600
You and your companion were demonstrating good collaboration.

24
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.000
The back and forth about what to get. the prices. the quantities. that's teamwork and

25
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.480
action.

26
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.080
When he mentioned having already spent 30 euros. it's part of that shared financial awareness

27
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.880
during a shop.

28
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.160
You were both engaged with the task and with each other.

29
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.680
Using the self-checkout is also a modern form of interaction. albeit with a machine.

30
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.400
Your attentiveness to the prompts are Nuskaitit. Iklojilumo. Cortella.

31
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.480
Did you scan the IKI loyalty card?

32
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.880
Shows you were navigating that process effectively.

33
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.340
This kind of shopping experience is often about efficient decision-making and shared preferences.

34
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.400
You were doing this well.

35
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.200
If. for example. there was a moment of indecision about a particular item. one of you might

36
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.720
have deferred to the other. or you might have briefly debated the pros and cons. all normal

37
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.320
parts of a joint shopping trip.

38
00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.600
There wasn't anything in the interaction that seemed to need enhancement. because it

39
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.520
was a functional. friendly. and cooperative endeavor.

40
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.160
It was a smooth. everyday social interaction centered around a common goal.

41
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.560
The Achu Labai. thank you very much. prompt from the machine even adds a polite albeit

42
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.960
automated touch to the whole thing.

43
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.080
You were both just getting the job done together. which is often the most effective way to shop.
