          I am an artist in Vilnius, Lithuania. In my work I tend to focus on reexamination of structures and systems relevant to my daily experience, analysing them from a critical, but empathetic point of view. I often use irony, metaphor, word play to express my conclusions, which are often inconclusive and paradoxical.
