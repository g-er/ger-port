          I am a multidisciplinary artist based in Vilnius, Lithuania. In my work I tend to focus on reexamination of structures and systems relevant to my life, analysing them in a critical, but multifaceted way. I often use irony, metaphor, word play to express my conclusions, which are often paradoxical.
